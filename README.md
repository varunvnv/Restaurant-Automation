# Restaurant-Automation

Our application that can be distinguished from other implementations, can be summed up in the
following specific points:
1. Our system is designed to be used without any effort from the user. Other systems
implemented in previous years expect from the customer to use the system and order. We believe
that the customer should always be served. Therefore, the system is designed to only be used by
staff.
2. Our system will help automate the table assignment by the manager to the waiters. Other
projects do not take into account this important part of a restaurantâ€™s management process. The
automation of this process will organize the workflow of the restaurant manager and help in
coordinating the collaboration between the manager and the waiters.
3 Our system provides an extra feature for the customers to book a table in advance through
restaurant website. This feature helps the customers at peak times when they do not want to wait
for the tables to be free.
